            <p>Hawaii (/həˈwaɪi/ (audio speaker iconlisten) hə-WY-ee; Hawaiian: Hawaiʻi [həˈvɐjʔi] or
                [həˈwɐjʔi]) is a
                state in the Western United States, located in the Pacific Ocean about 2,000 miles from the U.S.
                mainland. It is the only state outside North America, the only state that is an archipelago, and the
                only state in the tropics. Hawaii is also one of four U.S. states that were once independent nations
                along with Vermont, Texas and California.</p>

            <p>Hawaii comprises nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 volcanic islands spanning 1,500
                miles
                (2,400 km) that are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.
                The state's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth longest in the U.S., at about 750 miles (1,210
                km). The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi,
                Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻi, after which the state is named; it is often called the "Big Island" or
                "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian
                Islands make up most of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the nation's largest protected
                area and the third largest in the world.
            </p>
            <p>Of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii is the eighth-smallest in land area and the 11th-least
                populous, but with
                1.4 million residents ranks 13th in population density. Two-thirds of the population lives on O'ahu,
                home to the state's capital and largest city, Honolulu. Hawaii is among the country's most diverse
                states, owing to its central location in the Pacific and over two centuries of migration. As one of only
                six majority-minority states, it has the nation's only Asian American plurality, its largest Buddhist
                community, and the largest proportion of multiracial people. Consequently, it is a unique melting pot of
                North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian heritage.

                alt="mavrica">
            <p style="float:left;">Settled by Polynesians some time between 1000 and 1200 CE, Hawaii was home to
                numerous
                independent
                chiefdoms.In 1778, British explorer James Cook was the first known non-Polynesian to arrive at the
                archipelago; early British influence is reflected in the state flag, which bears a Union Jack. An influx
                of European and American explorers, traders, and whalers arrived shortly thereafter, introducing
                diseases that decimated the once isolated indigenous community. Hawaii became a unified, internationally
                recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until Western businessmen overthrew the monarchy in
                1893; this led to annexation by the U.S. in 1898. As a strategically valuable U.S. territory, Hawaii was
                attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global and historical significance, and
                contributed to America's decisive entry into World War II. Hawaii is the most recent state to join the
                union, on August 21, 1959. In 1993, the U.S. government formally apologized for its role in the
                overthrow of Hawaii's government, which spurred the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.
            </p>
            <p>Historically dominated by a plantation economy, Hawaii remains a major agricultural exporter
                due to its
                fertile soil and uniquely tropical climate in the U.S. Its economy has gradually diversified since the
                mid-20th century, with tourism and military defense becoming the two largest sectors. The state attracts
                tourists, surfers, and scientists from around the world with its diverse natural scenery, warm tropical
                climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big
                Island. Hawaii hosts the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the world's largest naval command, as well as 75,000
                employees of the Defense Department.</p>
            <div style="clear: both;"></div>
            <p>Although its relative isolation results in one of the nation's highest costs of living,
                Hawaii is the
                third-wealthiest state.
